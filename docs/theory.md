# Theory

## Why color based cryptography?

The theory of color based cryptography is based on 3 cryptography principles:

    1. obsfucation
    2. diffusion
    3. confusion

### Obfuscation

Obfuscation is the process of hiding the meaning of data in order to prevent unauthorized access. In color based cryptography, obfuscation is achieved by converting the data into a color image while while preserving the main look of the image. In theory, the image should look like a normal image but in reality, it contains the data that needs to be hidden.

##### Implementation of obfuscation

TODO:

### Diffusion

Diffusion is the process of input data over the out put making it hard to determine the original data. In color based cryptography, diffusion is achieved by spreading the data over the image in such a way that it is hard to determine where the data is located.

### Confusion

Confusion is the process of making the relationship between the data and the key as complex as possible. In color based cryptography, confusion is achieved by using a key to encrypt the data in such a way that it is hard to decrypt the data without the key.
