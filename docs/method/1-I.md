## First Insecure Variation

1 I is the first insecure variation of the Color Cipher encryption method. It is a basic encryption method that does not use a key to encrypt and decrypt data. The data is encoded into binary format and embedded into an image without any additional encryption.

### Implementation

The implementation of the 1 I variation involves the following steps:

1. **Data Encoding**: The data to be encoded is converted into binary format.
2. **Data Diffusion**: The binary data is diffused into the color values of the pixels in the image.
2. **Image Generation**: An image is generated to hide the binary data.

#### Data Encoding

The data encoding process involves converting the data into binary format. This is done by having a predefined mapping of characters to binary values. For our purpose, we will use the following mapping:
```plaintext
            Value Binary
                =000000
               a=000001
               b=000010
               c=000011
               d=000100
               e=000101
               f=000110
               g=000111
               h=001000
               i=001001
               j=001010
               k=001011
               l=001100
               m=001101
               n=001110
               o=001111
               p=010000
               q=010001
               r=010010
               s=010011
               t=010100
               u=010101
               v=010110
               w=010111
               x=011000
               y=011001
               z=011010
               A=011011
               B=011100
               C=011101
               D=011110
               E=011111
               F=100000
               G=100001
               H=100010
               I=100011
               J=100100
               K=100101
               L=100110
               M=100111
               N=101000
               O=101001
               P=101010
               Q=101011
               R=101100
               S=101101
               T=101110
               U=101111
               V=110000
               W=110001
               X=110010
               Y=110011
               Z=110100
 START OF NUMBER=110101
   END OF NUMBER=110110
   START OF TEXT=110111
     END OF TEXT=111000
START OF NEW KEY=111001
  END OF NEW KEY=111010
 START OF SYMBOL=111011
   END OF SYMBOL=111100
           BLANK=111101
               .=111110
               ,=111111
```

The data encoding process involves converting each character in the data to its corresponding binary value. Some special binary values are used to denote the start and end of numbers, text, keys, symbols, and blanks. These special values are used to differentiate between different types of data in the binary stream. You may notice that the first character appears to be missing from the mapping table it is because it is a whitespace character " " or SPACE and is represented by the binary value 000000. There will be no special value for SPACE as it is a common character and will be used to separate words in the data. The "." and "," characters are included in the mapping table as trimming the table to exclude them would not save any space.

#### Data Diffusion

The data diffusion process involves embedding the binary data into the color values of the pixels in the image. Each pixel in the image has three color values: red, green, and blue a maximum of 8 bits can be stored in each color value. The binary data is 6 bits long, so to achieve a data saturation of 100% the formula will be used below.
