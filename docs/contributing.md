## Development Guidelines

### Code Formatting

We follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code style. Use tools like `flake8` and `black` to ensure your code adheres to these guidelines.

- **Indentation:** Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
- **Imports:** Order imports in the following manner:
  1. Standard library imports
  2. Related third-party imports
  3. Local application/library-specific imports

Example:

```python
import os
import sys

import requests

from .my_module import my_function
```

### Character Capitalization and Naming Conventions

Consistent naming conventions and capitalization are crucial for readability and maintainability. Here are the guidelines:

- **Variables:** Use lowercase words separated by underscores.

  ```python
  max_length = 100
  user_name = "Derek"
  ```

- **Constants:** Use all uppercase letters with words separated by underscores.

  ```python
  MAX_RETRIES = 5
  API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
  ```

- **Functions and Methods:** Use lowercase words separated by underscores.

  ```python
  def calculate_area(radius):
      pass

  def fetch_data(url):
      pass
  ```

- **Classes:** Use CamelCase for class names, starting each word with a capital letter.

  ```python
  class DataProcessor:
      pass

  class UserAccount:
      pass
  ```

- **Modules and Packages:** Use short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used if it improves readability.

  ```python
  import my_module
  from color_cipher import cipher_utils
  ```

- **Files:** Use lowercase words separated by underscores.

  ```plaintext
  my_script.py
  data_loader.py
  ```

### Commit Messages

Write clear and concise commit messages. Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification:

- **feat:** A new feature
- **fix:** A bug fix
- **docs:** Documentation changes
- **style:** Code formatting changes (white space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor:** Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- **test:** Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore:** Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

Example:

```git commit

```
