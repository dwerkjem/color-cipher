# Theory

Why color-based cryptography?

The theory of color-based cryptography is based on 3 cryptography principles:

    1. obfuscation
    2. diffusion
    3. confusion

### Obfuscation

Obfuscation is the process of hiding the meaning of data to prevent unauthorized access. In color-based cryptography, obfuscation is achieved by converting the data into a color image while preserving the main look of the image. In theory, the image should look like a normal image but in reality, it contains the data that needs to be hidden.

##### Implementation of obfuscation

The implementation of obfuscation is done by converting the data into an image that looks like a normal image.

### Diffusion

Diffusion is the process of input data over the output making it hard to determine the original data. In color-based cryptography, diffusion is achieved by spreading the data over the image in such a way that it is hard to determine where the data is located.

### Confusion

Confusion is the process of making the relationship between the data and the key as complex as possible. In color-based cryptography, confusion is achieved by using a key to encrypt the data in such a way that it is hard to decrypt the data without the key
