## Overview

The Color Cipher encryption method involves the following steps:

1. **Data Encoding**: The data to be encrypted is encoded into binary format.
2. **Image Selection**: An image is selected to hide the data in. An algorithm is used to determine the viability of the image for steganographic encryption.
3. **Key Generation**: A key is generated to encrypt and decrypt the data.
